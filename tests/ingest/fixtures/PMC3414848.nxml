            <abstract>
                <p>Purpose of the present study was the generation and evaluation of novel thiolated chitosans,
                    so-named S-protected thiolated chitosans as mucosal drug delivery systems. Stability of all
                    conjugates concerning swelling and disintegration behavior as well as drug release was examined.
                    Mucoadhesive properties were evaluated in vitro on intestinal mucosa. Different thiolated chitosans
                    were generated displaying increasing amounts of attached free thiol groups on the polymer, whereby
                    more than 50% of these thiol groups were linked with 6-mercaptonicotinamide. Based on the
                    implementation of this hydrophobic residue, the swelling behavior was 2-fold decreased, whereas
                    stability was essentially improved. Their mucoadhesive properties were 2- and 14-fold increased
                    compared to corresponding thiolated and unmodified chitosans, respectively. Release studies out of
                    matrix tablets comprising the novel conjugates revealed a controlled release of a model peptide.
                </p>
                <p>Accordingly, S-protected thiomers represent a promising type of mucoadhesive polymers for the
                    development of various mucosal drug delivery systems.

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>As the uptake of most drugs from mucosal membranes is controlled by a passive diffusion process, it is
                essential to provide a concentration gradient as steep as possible on the mucosa. In order to achieve
                that goal, the delivery system has to be kept as long as possible in contact with the absorption
                membrane, which can be guaranteed by mucoadhesive polymers. They can increase the intimate contact time
                with mucus surfaces resulting in increased drug concentration at the site of absorption and
                consequently improved overall bioavailability. In contrast to &#x02018;conventional&#x02019; polymers,
                which are quite insufficient in order to guarantee this effect and whose mucoadhesive properties are
                only based on non-covalent bonds, thiolated polymers (thiomers) are capable of forming covalent bonds
                with cysteine-rich subdomains of the mucus gel layer via disulfide exchange reactions (<xref
                        rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Bernkop-Schn&#x000fc;rch, Schwarz, &#x00026; Steininger,
                    1999</xref>). Mucoadhesive, permeation enhancing and efflux pump inhibitory properties of
                poly(acrylic acid) and chitosan, were strongly improved by thiolation (<xref rid="bib0020 bib0080"
                                                                                             ref-type="bibr">
                    Bernkop-Schn&#x000fc;rch, Hornof, &#x00026; Zoidl, 2003; Marsch&#x000fc;tz &#x00026; Bernkop-Schn&#x000fc;rch,
                    2002</xref>). Besides all these advantages, however, thiomers show comparatively low stability in
                solutions, as they are subject of thiol oxidation at pH &#x02265;6 unless sealed under inert conditions
                (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Bernkop-Schn&#x000fc;rch et al., 2003</xref>). This hindrance
                limits their permeation enhancement and mucoadhesive features in body regions, where pH is raised. The
                design and development of thiomers being stable in liquid and semisolid formulations would therefore be
                highly advantageous, opening the door for numerous additional applications. According to this, it was
                the aim of the present study to generate thiolated polymers, whose thiol groups are protected by
                already formed disulfide bonds, which offer the advantage of not being subject of oxidation. The
                hypothesis to achieve this goal is based on covalent chromatography, where, for instance, peptides and
                proteins are very efficiently linked to thiol bearing resins, when they are preactivated via pyridyl
                substructures (<xref rid="bib0035 bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Carlsson, Drevin, &#x00026; Ax&#x000e9;n,
                    1978; Norris &#x00026; Brocklehurst, 1976</xref>). Pyridyl disulfides react very rapidly and
                quantitatively with sulfhydryl groups over a broad pH range to form disulfide bonds. During this
                reaction, a disulfide exchange occurs between the molecule's &#x02014;SH group and the pyridyl thiol
                group, i.e. the thiomer forms disulfide bonds with cysteine-rich subdomains of mucus glycoproteins with
                the pyridyl thiol moiety as leaving group. The pyridyl thiol leaving group, however, is from the
                toxicological point of view problematic. Utilizing nicotinamide (vitamin B3) instead of the pyridyl
                group excludes such toxic effects. In order to apply this novel concept for thiolated chitosans, it was
                the aim of this study to synthesize and characterize an S-protected thiolated chitosan regarding its
                application in mucosal drug delivery systems.

                    involved the covalent attachment of thioglycolic acid (TGA) to chitosan (CS) due to the formation
                    of amide bonds between the primary amino groups of the polymer and carboxylic acid groups of TGA as

                    of disulfide bonds. The amount of free thiol groups was determined photometrically with Ellman's

                    TGA-MNA-980) displayed 170, 400 and 690&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol of covalently attached 6-MNA per gram
                    thiomer. Samples without addition of GSH displayed only a negligible amount of 6-MNA. All
                    lyophilized conjugates were white, of fibrous structure and low water soluble. Solubility in
                    aqueous solutions decreased by a higher amount of conjugated 6-MNA, which might be based on the
                    hydrophobic character and higher content of disulfide bonds.
                </p>
                <p>The coupling reaction was on the one hand carried out by use of the monomer 6-MNA with an oxygen
                    donating compound (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and on the other hand by use of its dimer 6,6&#x02032;-DTNA
                    through cleavage of the disulfide bond to give 6-MNA. For reaction with 6-MNA, it is assumed that
                    thiol groups convert into their deprotonated form thiolate anions (RS<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) or
                    activated thiol groups at low pH values by hydrogen peroxide. Nucleophilic attack of an activated
                    thiol group can lead to a disulfide bond with another thiol group (<xref rid="bib0010"
                                                                                             ref-type="bibr">Barrett et
                        al., 1999</xref>). The dimeric reagent, however, reacted with the thiomer to form a mixed
                    disulfide under release of 6-MNA. In this reaction way, additional oxidizing agents were not
                    necessary, whereby the risk of oxidation between molecules in solution was minimized. In addition,
                    coupling through reaction with dimer was at least 2-fold higher compared to reaction with monomer.
                    The best molar ratio of thiol groups on the thiomer and aromatic ligand was found to be 1:2 with a
                    coupling rate of more than 50%. Higher ratios generated immediate precipitations of the aromatic
                    ligand owing to an insufficient amount of DMSO in the reaction mixture with each thiomer. The
                    dissolution of hydrophilic thiomer on the one hand and hydrophobic ligand on the other hand in the
                    same medium was a major obstacle. Due to the insolubility and precipitation of 6-MNA in aqueous
                    solutions, the thiomer had to be dissolved in a mixture of DMSO and water, whereby the ratio has to
                    be shifted to the side of DMSO. Consequently, the best ratio found for DMSO/water mixture was 7:3.
                    Syntheses with monomer were done at pH 7&#x02013;8, due to the oxidation process with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>
                        2</sub>. For reactions with dimer, several pH values were tested. Syntheses at a pH value of
                    around 6 resulted in the highest coupling rate. Due to the photometric control (297 and 307&#x000a0;nm)
                    every 2&#x000a0;h, all reactions were found to be completed after 6&#x000a0;h. Extension the
                    reaction time up to 24&#x000a0;h had no significant effect on the coupling rate. <xref

                    percentage of cell viability after an incubation of 3 or 24&#x000a0;h. Furthermore, neither the
                    monomeric nor the dimeric reagent induced severe toxicity with more than 88% of viable cells after
                    24&#x000a0;h. Quantitative assessment of viable cells after 24&#x000a0;h contact with S-protected
                    thiomers showed at least 83% mitochondrial activity indicating a likely non-toxic nature of this
                    class of thiolated polymers. In case of all thiomers, viability of cells deceased to approximately
                    77% after 24&#x000a0;h of incubation. A reason for this reduction might be the increase in
                    viscosity of all thiomers due to an intramolecular disulfide bond formation, which cannot take
                    place in the same extent in case of the already oxidized S-protected thiomers. Rheological

                <title>Evaluation of the disintegration behavior</title>
                <p>The disintegration behavior of thiolated and S-protected polymers compressed into tablets is a good
                    indicator for their mucoadhesive and cohesive features. Disintegration was first tested in 0.1&#x000a0;M
                    HCl for 2&#x000a0;h, revealing the stability of this new class of protected thiomers towards acetic
                    conditions. Unmodified chitosan tablets disintegrate in about 10&#x000a0;min, thiomer tablets
                    dissolved after maximum 50&#x000a0;min and S-protected thiomer tablets were stable for a period of
                    2&#x000a0;h, representing a 12-fold increased stability compared to unmodified tablets. To induce a
                    disintegration of these S-protected tablets, studies were continued in phosphate buffer pH 6.8
                    containing 5&#x000a0;mM reduced glutathione. GSH was able to reduce the disulfide bonds inside the
                    polymer, whereby tablets were disintegrated after 9&#x000a0;h incubation. These results revealed a
                    much higher stability towards acetic conditions of test discs based on S-protected thiolated
                    chitosan in comparison to their corresponding thiomers and unmodified control as shown in <xref

                <p>Additionally, hardness of all tablets was checked for resistance to crushing. Results were in good
                    agreement with outcomes of disintegration and water uptake studies and revealed that CS tablets
                    exhibit with 30&#x000a0;N the lowest cohesiveness. Hardness of tablets increased with raising
                    degree of cross-linking. Hence, TGA-MNA-980 tablets displayed with 175&#x000a0;N the highest
                    stability, followed by TGA-MNA-660 with 160&#x000a0;N, TGA-MNA-340 with 140&#x000a0;N, CS-TGA-980
                    with 135&#x000a0;N, CS-TGA-660 with 115&#x000a0;N and CS-TGA-340 with 105&#x000a0;N. The observed
                    higher cohesiveness of S-protected tablets can be explained by their higher amount of cross-linked
                    disulfide bonds within the polymeric network. However, both modification steps (thiolation and
                    S-protection) stabilized the tablets compared to the unmodified ones. Overall, disulfide bonds are
                    an integral part of the structure of polymers containing thiol groups and contribute to enhanced

                <title>Evaluation of the swelling behavior</title>
                <p>Swelling behavior of matrix tablets has a great impact on their adhesive and cohesive properties,
                    drug release and stability. Results revealed that tablets of unmodified CS swelled more rapid in
                    the beginning than thiolated and S-protected ones, because of their stronger hydrophilic character
                    and higher number of charges on the polymer. After 2&#x000a0;h, a gradual decrease in the tablet
                    weight of unmodified CS was observed related to a slow erosion process within the following hours
                    of the experiment. This observation might be explained by the low cohesiveness of CS tablets and
                    the impossibility of cross-linking within the polymer backbone. Furthermore, results demonstrated
                    that the covalent attachment of TGA to CS has a significant influence (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05)
                    on the swelling behavior of the polymer. The weight of each thiolated tablet increased rapidly
                    after 1&#x000a0;h, steadily over the following 5&#x000a0;h and remained almost constant between 6
                    and 12&#x000a0;h of the experiment. Additionally, it could be shown that the higher are the amount
                    of conjugated thiol groups, the higher was the water absorption capacity. Tablets comprising
                    CS-TGA-980, for example, reached a maximum weight of 178&#x000a0;mg after 12&#x000a0;h,
                    representing a 6-fold increase of the initial weight compared to CS-TGA-340 with just a 3.7-fold
                    rise. An explanation for this effect is given by the higher amount of free and connected thiol
                    groups in case of CS-TGA-980 (<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Kafedjiiski, Krauland, Hoffer,
                        &#x00026; Bernkop-Schn&#x000fc;rch, 2005</xref>). However, due to this cross-linking process,
                    tablets can absorb water in quantities which are multiples of their own weight and can fixate them
                    firmly within their polymer networks. In contrast, the incorporation of an aromatic ligand on the
                    thiomer backbone reduced the swelling behavior of all S-protected tablets. TGA-MNA-980 tablets, for
                    instance, gained a maximum weight of 105&#x000a0;mg after 12&#x000a0;h incubation, which is more
                    than 40% lower than that of CS-TGA-980 tablets. In addition, it could be shown that water uptake
                    for all S-protected tablets depends on the amount of covalently attached 6-MNA and remaining free
                    thiol groups. Due to a pronounced hydrophobic character, it took longer until water could penetrate
                    inside the tablet and intramolecular disulfide bond formation of remaining free thiol groups took
                    place. Consequently, the amount of covalently attached aromatic ligand as well as remaining free
                    thiol groups on the S-protected tablet are responsible for a slower swelling in the beginning
                    following an increased water uptake once water began to penetrate into the tablet. Nevertheless, <xref

                    Mucoadhesive materials need to take up water from the underlying mucosal tissues by absorbing,
                    swelling and capillary effects leading to a considerably stronger adhesion. However, excessive
                    water uptake will lead to overhydration forming slippery mucilage and result in less adhesiveness (<xref

                    CS-TGA-660 and TGA-MNA-660 tablets. S-protected tablets showed a significantly (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05)
                    slower release of the hydrophilic peptide drug in comparison to their corresponding thiolated and
                    unmodified chitosan tablets. Within 6&#x000a0;h, for instance, already 100% of leuprolide were
                    released out of the chitosan tablet in comparison to 80% for the thiolated and 72% for the
                    S-protected tablet. The fast swelling of the unmodified tablet might be the reason for a fast
                    release of the drug within the first 2&#x000a0;h followed by a slower but still increasing release
                    over the last 4&#x000a0;h. Their strong swelling behavior might be the reason for a rapid
                    penetration of the matrix tablets and consequently faster release of the drug. Furthermore, due to
                    the slow erosion process of the chitosan tablets as described above, the peptide could be easily
                    released. Owing to the higher cohesiveness and lower swelling behavior of the S-protected tablets
                    release kinetics of the drug were affected and a sustained release could be received, whereby a
                    prolonged therapeutic level of drugs exhibiting a short elimination half-live can be maintained.
                    Consequently, the frequency of dosing could be reduced contributing to an improved compliance.

                    <p>Mucoadhesive properties of the S-protected thiolated chitosans were on the one hand tested by
                        rotating cylinder method. This method is supposed to simulate an in vivo situation, as it
                        imitates the adhesion and cohesiveness of the polymer in physiological medium. Unmodified
                        chitosan tablets detached from the intestinal mucosa or solved within 10&#x000a0;h, while
                        thiolated and S-protected tablets remained attached for at least 32&#x000a0;h (CS-TGA-340) and
                        50&#x000a0;h (TGA-MNA-340) demonstrating at least 3.2- and 5-fold improved mucoadhesive
                        properties. This effect was more pronounced for MNA-660 tablets, which were adhesive on the
                        mucosa for at least 90&#x000a0;h, resulting in a 2-fold improvement compared to their
                        corresponding thiomer tablets (CS-TGA-660) and 9-fold to unmodified chitosan tablets. Compared
                        with previous studies, chitosan-4-butylamidine for example with 240&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/g
                        thiol groups remained on the mucosa for more than 161&#x000a0;h (<xref rid="bib0050"

                        the fully immersed cylinder was agitated with 125&#x000a0;rpm only, whereas the rotational
                        speed in the present study was set to 200&#x000a0;rpm and the experiment was stopped after 120&#x000a0;h.
                        Nevertheless, neither the highest thiolated tablet (CS-TGA-980) nor the corresponding
                        S-protected tablet (TGA-MNA-980) were detached after this period, demonstrating the
                        effectiveness of this class of thiomers and placing them among the most mucoadhesive polymers

                    <title>Rheological investigation of polymer/mucin mixtures</title>
                    <p>Within this study, oscillatory measurements were performed within the linear viscoelasticity
                        region. Results provide information about dynamic properties of each thiomer solution (1%, m/v)
                        as well as mixtures of these polymers with 5% (m/v) mucin gel. In order to receive reproducible
                        results, rheological studies were performed with commercially available mucin instead of native
                        mucus as described by <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Rossi, Bonferoni, Ferrari, Bertoni,
                            and Caramella (1996)</xref>. Results of this study concerning apparent viscosity values are
                        shown in <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and in accordance with findings of
                        the previous mucoadhesion studies. Due to the addition of TGA to chitosan dynamic viscosity of
                        all thiomers increased during 60&#x000a0;min incubation at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C by at least
                        1.4-fold. In contrast, no significant change (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05)
                        in viscosity of chitosan as well as the S-protected thiomers could be detected after this
                        period. Situation was altered when samples were mixed with mucin gel. Apparent viscosity values
                        of CS-TGA-340, CS-TGA-660 and CS-TGA-980 showed a 2.3-, 2.7- and 4.6-fold increase compared to
                        thiomers without mucin gel. In case of TGA-MNA-340, TGA-MNA-660 and TGA-MNA-980 viscosity
                        increased by 2.7-, 4.2- and 4.7-fold when mucin was added to each sample. Strong mucoadhesive
                        properties of delivery systems can induce a considerable change in rheological properties of
                        the mucus layer (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Mortazavi &#x00026; Smart, 1994b</xref>).
                        Moreover, it has been reported that an increase in viscosity of mucus/polymer interface
                        directly correlates with the mucoadhesive properties of the polymer (<xref rid="bib0110"
                                                                                                   ref-type="bibr">
                            Smart, 2005</xref>). Results of rheological investigations implemented with thiomer and
                        S-protected thiomer/mucin mixtures provide a strong support for this theory.
                    </p>
                    <p>Mucoadhesion is a complex phenomenon which can be influenced by numerous physiochemical
                        conditions such as electrostatic forces. Positively charged CS however, interact with
                        negatively charged mucin through non-covalent bonds providing therefore relative weak
                        mucoadhesion in contrast to thiolated polymers (<xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Woodley,
                            2001</xref>). Based on their free thiol groups, thiomers possess the ability to form
                        covalent bonds with cysteine-rich subdomains of glycoproteins in the mucus layer. This process
                        can occur either by oxidative coupling of thiol groups and/or by thiol-disulfide exchange
                        reaction of the groups present in both polymer and mucus (<xref rid="bib0075 bib0100"
                                                                                        ref-type="bibr">Leitner,
                            Walker, &#x00026; Bernkop-Schn&#x000fc;rch, 2003; Perez-Vilar &#x00026; Mabolo, 2007</xref>).
                        While thiomers mainly react with disulfide bonds within the mucus, S-protected thiomers
                        interact very rapidly and quantitatively over a broad pH range by thiol disulfide exchange
                        reaction through cysteine subunits within the mucus to form disulfide bonds. During this
                        reaction, a disulfide exchange occurs between the molecules &#x02014;SH group and the pyridyl
                        thiol group, i.e. the S-protected thiomer forms disulfide bonds with cysteine-rich subdomains
                        of the mucus, whereby the pyridyl thiol moiety results as leaving group. Furthermore, as
                        determined by <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Barthelmes, Perera, Hombach, D&#x000fc;nnhaupt,
                            and Bernkop-Schn&#x000fc;rch (2011)</xref>, the average content of free thiol groups within
                        the mucus layer is almost twice as high as the content of disulfide bonds. According to these
                        outcomes, enhanced bonding between mucus and S-protected polymers can take place in contrast to
                        mucus/thiomer conjugation. In addition, the protection of thiol groups can prevent an early
                        oxidation before coming into contact with the mucus layer, whereby more active thiol groups are
                        available for a long time intimate contact with mucosal membranes. Thus, S-protected thiolated
                        chitosan could facilitate the oral uptake of several drugs by its strong mucoadhesive
                        properties.

            <title>Conclusion</title>
            <p>Within this study, a stable mucoadhesive chitosan, described as S-protected thiolated chitosan, has been
                synthesized and characterized in terms of mucoadhesion, swelling and disintegration behavior,
                controlled release and cytotoxic effects for the first time. The polymer was tested for its potential
                as novel pharmaceutical excipient. In vitro mucoadhesion studies revealed promising results and place
                this type of thiolated chitosan among the most effective mucoadhesive polymers. Furthermore, due to the
                chemical modification of thiolated chitosan, water-uptake capacity as well as cytotoxicity could be
                decreased, while cohesive properties were strongly improved. Hence, the implementation of thiolated
                pyridyl substructures on this thiolated backbone resulted in conjugates displaying improved
                mucoadhesive and cohesive properties. S-protected thiolated chitosan represents a stable and promising
                tool for the development of various mucoadhesive drug delivery systems. Overall, this novel class of
                thiolated chitosans containing protected thiol groups, offer the advantage of not being subject to any
                oxidation at all, which opens the door for numerous additional applications.

                    is first reacted with thiourea to get 6-mercaptonicotinamide (6-MNA) (1). This product is then
                    oxidized to 6,6&#x02032;-dithionicotinamide (6,6-DTNA) (2). Both reagents (6-MNA and 6,6-DTNA) were
                    added to chitosan-TGA to form S-protected thiolated chitosan (3).
